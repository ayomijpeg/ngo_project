            <h5>OUR PROJECT</h5>
            <h1>Education Awareness Program 2023</h1>
            <p>
                The awareness initiative, based on the "Smart Learn solutions government school," 
                will take vehicles for many fifty schools in the district, which will be flagged off 
                at two of the new towns.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to the official teachers, Ilam Thadi Katti Volunteers, and the education 
                department officials involved in this initiative, these digital smart vehicles 
                will ensure a new student-like experience, including a projector to showcase 
                visual-based content.
            </p>
            <p>
                In schools where students struggle with reinforcement of class, free teachers 
                have a particular hour been asked to pick up special initiatives making awareness 
                and encouraging parents to attend the studentâ€™s classes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the pandemic, the school education department saw an increase in 
                enrollments in government schools, particularly in high and higher secondary classes.
